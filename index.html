      <h2>Disscusion</h2>
      <p>The pretrained model correctly classified familiar everyday objects, places, landscapes, and representatives of flora and fauna in most cases.
However, accurate classification generally required photos with good contrast, high resolution, and a clear depiction of the main object.
It was particularly striking that even a partial view, such as a fragment of a tandem bicycle, led to a highly accurate classification, although even the human eye struggles to detect the second set of pedals and handlebars.
On the other hand, the model's performance declined when images were more abstract, contained multiple objects, or when the objects showed a similar appearance but belonged to different classes.
For example, classifying the Laika dog breed proved difficult, as it is easily confused with other breeds or even wolves.
Several test images of this breed consistently resulted in misclassifications.
A notable failure also appeared in the recognition of the Eiffel Tower, where neither standard photographs nor mosaic representations were correctly classified.
This suggests that both landmarks and famous structures are not reliably recognized by the model.
Non-standard visual forms and artistic styles appear to pose a considerable challenge for accurate classification.
Overall, the experiment demonstrated both the strengths and the limitations of pretrained models when dealing with varying image complexities.</p>
