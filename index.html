      <h2>Disscusion</h2>
      <p>In the course of the task, I came to several conclusions about classifying photos with ml5.js imageClassifier. 
        The pretrained model correctly classified familiar everyday objects, places, landscapes, and representatives 
        of the flora and fauna in most cases. However, for correct classification, photos with good contrast and resolution 
        are needed. It was surprising to me that even a fragment of a photo like the tandem bike leads to such an accurate 
        result, although it is difficult even for the human eye to recognize the second pair of pedals and handlebars. 
        I was impressed that if the photos are more abstract, contain several different objects, or the searched objects 
        have similar appearance but different classes, the classification is not always accurate. I took as an example a 
        breed of dog that can easily be confused with several others, even with a wolf. Apparently it is quite specific, 
        because the sample with different photos of animals of this breed did not give a single good result.</p>
