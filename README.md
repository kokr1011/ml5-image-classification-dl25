# 📷 Image Classification Web App using ml5.js and MobileNet

This is a web application that performs real-time image classification using the MobileNet model via the ml5.js library. It allows users to view classification results for predefined images and upload their own images for classification.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 📋 Features
- Image classification using a pretrained MobileNet model.
- Real-time classification of uploaded images (Drag & Drop or File Upload).
- Visualization of classification results via bar charts (Chart.js).
- Loading animation and smooth fade-in transitions.
- Client-side only (no server needed).
- Hosted publicly via GitHub Pages.
